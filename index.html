            The Chief Executive Officer, Premium Trust Bank, Emmanuel Emefienim,
            said the active participation of women in corporate leadership will
            help the country to achieve growth and sustainable development. <br> He
            disclosed this on March 8, during a landmark celebration of
            International Women’s Day, with the theme, ‘Inspire her: Inspiring
            women for growth and inclusion,’ in Lagos State. <br><br> Emefienim stated
            that women had made significant contributions to corporate decisions
            and economic advancement across the country. <br><br> He emphasised that the
            novel titled, ‘She Premium,’ was launched at the event to serve as a
            creative solution designed just for women to assist in their
            personal and professional growth. <br><br> He said, “Women play a critical
            role in corporate decision-making and the broader economy. Women
            possess immense potential that, when harnessed in decision-making
            roles, can lead to unparalleled growth and innovation in the
            country, as is the case with PremiumTrust Bank.
